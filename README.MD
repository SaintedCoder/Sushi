# Sushi

Free, open-source bento rigging and animation tools for Blender 5.0+

Sushi is a community continuation of the original open-source Onigiri / Bento Buddy code (GPLv3).  
All features are free forever. No subscriptions, no hidden services.

### Current modules
- Core rigging & export (SL/OpenSim ready)
- CaliforniaRoll – real-time facial puppeteering (webcam → bento face)
- (more modules coming – all optional and free)

Just enable the ones you want in Blender’s addon preferences.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to the original open-source tools that made this possible.
